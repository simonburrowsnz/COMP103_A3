/**
 * Simulation of a Hospital ER
 * 
 * The hospital has a collection of Departments, including the ER department, each of which has
 *  and a treatment room.
 * 
 * When patients arrive at the hospital, they are immediately assessed by the
 *  triage team who determine the priority of the patient and (unrealistically) a sequence of treatments 
 *  that the patient will need.
 *
 * The simulation should move patients through the departments for each of the required treatments,
 * finally discharging patients when they have completed their final treatment.

/**
 * Represents an ER Patient at a Hospital
 * Each Patient has
 *     a name and
 *     initials,
 *     an arrival time,
 *     total waiting time
 *     total treatment time
 *  and has been examined by the triage team at reception who has assigned
 *     a priority (1 - 3)  and
 *     a queue of treatments that Patient must have
 *       (scans, examinations, operations, etc)
 *       each treatment will have a department name and the amount of time the treatment will take
 *     The treatment at the head of the queue is the "current treatment" which the patient is about to start
 *       or is currently undergoing.
 *   NOTE: For the core, you can ignore all but the first treatment.
 * 
 *  Possible departments:  ER, X-Ray, MRI, UltraSound, Surgery

 * Methods:
 *   compareTo(other)        -> int       [You need to complete]
 *   redraw(x, y)
 *   toString()              -> String
 *   getPriority()           -> int
 *   getTotalWaitingTime()   -> int
 *   getTotalTreatmentTime() -> int
 *
 *   waitForATick()
 *   advanceCurrentTreatmentByTick()
 *   currentTreatmentFinished() -> boolean
 *
 *   [THE FOLLOWING ARE NOT NEEDED FOR THE CORE]
 *   allTreatmentsCompleted()    -> boolean  
 *   removeCurrentTreatment
 *   getCurrentDepartment()       -> String (name of department for the treatment needed now)

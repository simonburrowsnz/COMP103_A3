/**
 * Simple Simulation of a Hospital ER
 * 
 * The Emergency room has a waiting room and a treatment room that has a fixed
 *  set of beds for examining and treating patients.
 * 
 * When a patient arrives at the emergency room, they are immediately assessed by the
 *  triage team who determines the priority of the patient.
 *
 * They then wait in the waiting room until a bed becomes free, at which point
 * they go from the waiting room to the treatment room.
 *
 * When a patient has finished their treatment, they leave the treatment room and are discharged,
 *  at which point information about the patient is added to the statistics. 
 *
 *  READ THE ASSIGNMENT PAGE!
